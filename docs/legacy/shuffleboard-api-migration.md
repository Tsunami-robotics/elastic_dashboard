### Code-Driven Layouts

Migrating Shuffleboard API layouts to remote downloading layouts is simple:

1. Clear all tabs and widgets of your dashboard, it is recommended you save your layout to a safe location before doing this step
2. Connect to your robot to populate Elastic with the code-driven layout
3. Export your dashboard layout
4. Set up the remote layout downloading as described [here](shuffleboard-api-migration.md#on-robot-configuration)

After migrating your layout, it is advised to remove any Shuffleboard API-related code from your robot project.
